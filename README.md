# Labyrinth
This is a labyrinth generation tool, created for educational purposes in order to practice Rust and maze generation algorithm. Might also include dungeon generation algorithms later. It works with `crossterm` and is compatible with most terminals.

## To-Do list:
* [ ] implement select-list to select generation algorithm
* [ ] [kruskal's algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/3/maze-generation-kruskal-s-algorithm)
* [ ] [Prim's Algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/1/10/maze-generation-prim-s-algorithm)
